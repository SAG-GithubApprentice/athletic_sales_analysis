Project Summary: Athletic Sales Data Analysis

Summary:

    This project involves the analysis of athletic sales data using Python and the pandas library. The script combines and cleans data from 2020 and 2021, providing insights into various aspects of sales trends. Key analyses include determining regions with the highest products sold, identifying regions with the most sales, and finding retailers with the highest sales. The project also focuses on women's athletic footwear sales, examining both daily and weekly trends. The provided README.md offers a comprehensive guide for installation, usage, and contribution to the project.

Analysis Steps:

    1. Combine and Clean the Data
    The script reads CSV files for 2020 and 2021, combines them, and cleans the data.

    2. Determine which Region Sold the Most Products
    The analysis identifies regions with the highest total products sold, using both groupby and pivot_table methods.

    3. Determine which Region had the Most Sales
    Similar to the previous step, this section focuses on total sales instead of units sold.

    4. Determine which Retailer had the Most Sales
    Analyzing total sales by retailer across different regions.

    5. Determine which Retailer Sold the Most Women's Athletic Footwear
    Specific analysis for women's athletic footwear sales, both by retailer and region.

    5. Determine the Day with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales
    Analyzing daily sales data for women's athletic footwear.

    6. Determine the Week with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales
    Analyzing weekly sales data for women's athletic footwear.
